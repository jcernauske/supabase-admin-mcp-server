- ✅ **RLS status checking** for all tables
- ✅ **Security dashboard view** with risk assessment

### 2. **Enhanced Authorization**
- ✅ **Optional Admin API Key** - Additional security layer beyond service key
- ✅ **Environment-based controls** - Different rules for dev/staging/production
- ✅ **Production confirmation** - Requires explicit confirmation for destructive operations
- ✅ **Operation-specific authorization** - Granular permission checking

### 3. **Comprehensive Audit Logging**
- ✅ **Migration audit trail** - Complete history of all operations
- ✅ **Performance tracking** - Execution time monitoring
- ✅ **Error logging** - Failed operations tracked
- ✅ **User attribution** - Who performed what operation
- ✅ **Environment tracking** - Separate audit trails per environment

### 4. **SQL Security Analysis**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jcernauske/supabase-admin-mcp-server.git
cd supabase-admin-mcp-server
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Enhanced Security Setup
```bash
# Copy and configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your settings including:
# - ENVIRONMENT (development/staging/production)
# - ADMIN_API_KEY (optional additional security)
# - REQUIRE_CONFIRMATION (true for production safety)
```

### 3. Database Security Setup
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor, run:
-- 1. Basic migrations table
\i migrations_setup.sql

-- 2. Enhanced security features
\i security_setup.sql
```

### 4. Claude Desktop Configuration
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "supabase-admin-secure": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["/path/to/supabase-admin-mcp-server/main.py"],
      "env": {
        "SUPABASE_URL": "https://your-project.supabase.co",
        "SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY": "your-service-key",
        "ENVIRONMENT": "development",
        "ADMIN_API_KEY": "your-admin-key",
        "REQUIRE_CONFIRMATION": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 🛡️ Security Controls in Action

### Development Environment
- ✅ All operations allowed
- ✅ Basic audit logging
- ✅ Security warnings displayed

### Production Environment
- ✅ Confirmation required for destructive operations
- ✅ High-risk migrations require manual review
- ✅ Enhanced audit logging
- ✅ Additional API key verification (if configured)

### Example Usage
```
# Development - works normally
"Create a migration to add a users table"

# Production - requires confirmation
"Apply this migration" 
→ "Production operation requires confirmation. Add 'confirm': 'yes'"

# Security audit
"Check my database security status"
→ Shows RLS status, security risks, recommendations
```
